<p>Instructor: Russell Green</p>
<p>Course Description: This course is an introduction to web-based software engineering environments, design patterns, frameworks and key architectural aspects of robust enterprise applications. Topics for software development technologies include development languages and frameworks (e.g., .NET, NodeJS, Java, open-source), various tools used during the development lifecycle, and key components of an application in terms of the data, process and presentation layers.

The emphasis is on hands-on software development in JavaScript (MEAN stack), C# and other programming languages in modern software engineering environments.

This is a hand’s on application development course that introduces the latest web technologies, methodologies, libraries, and program languages used in open source and commercial applications - today. The purpose of this course is to actively engage the students by helping them to work on projects and assignments.  The course is divided into four modules. </p>

<p>Instructor:  Naveen Allu</p>
<p>Course Description: This course prepares the students to analyze business information systems in the digital age and to build models and logical designs that can be later implemented. Emphasis in the beginning of this course is on understanding the business processes and business requirements and building conceptual models that help in analysis of business requirements. The second part of this course prepares the students to design complex systems and to build designs and architectures that can be later implemented. The course emphasizes business process modeling, business patterns, object orientation, design patterns and component-based design approaches. Topics include modern system life cycles, project management, BRODE (buy, rent, outsource, develop, extend) strategies in system building, business system modeling, requirements analysis, conceptual design, architectures, physical design, and design for the modern mobile systems with security and integration considerations. Several real life case studies will be discussed.</p>

<p>Instructor: Saeed Esmaili-Sardari, PhD</p>
<p>Course Decription: Completion of at least 18 graduate semester hours Description: This course guides the student to develop and finalize a selected research problem and to construct a proposal that effectively establishes the basis for either writing a thesis or launching an experiential capstone project. The course provides an overview of strategies for effective problem investigation and solution proposal. Research methodology is studies and applied as part of suggesting a solution to a problem. Writing and formatting techniques are also explored and applied as a communication tool for cataloging the investigation and recommending the solution.</p><br/>
